Overview
========

*pyratemp is a very simple, easy to use, small, fast, powerful, modular,
extensible, well documented and pythonic template-engine for Python*.

It's a template-engine of my "category 3" as described in my `thoughts about
Template Engines`_.

It uses a template-language with a small set of Python-like control-structures
(if/elif/else, for, and user-defined macros/functions) and directly benefits
from Python by using Python-expressions [#]_.

It's extremely easy to use in Python, well documented and produces good
error-messages (incl. line- and column-position) when there is an error in
a template.

Additionally, it's extensible and its code is quite small and readable.

.. _thoughts about Template Engines: http://www.simple-is-better.org/template/
.. [#] or: "pseudo-sandboxed" Python expressions, see `Evaluation`_


Features
--------

My template-engine has everything I think a template-engine needs:

- variable-substitution, incl. special-character-escaping
  (e.g. HTML, mail_header, LaTeX)
- conditionals (if/elif/else), loops (for/else)
- template-defined functions/macros/variables
- inclusion of other templates

- very powerful expressions (due to Python)
- `pseudo-sandbox`_: the Python-expressions are evaluated inside a
  "pseudo-sandbox" which prevents that "bad things" are done by
  accident; and even a "real" sandbox could be added

- clear template syntax ("There should be one -- and preferably only one --
  obvious way to do it." [#]_)
- non-XML, so it can be used for any kind of documents
- good error-handling and good error-messages, incl. the exact position
  of an error in the template-file
- completely uses Unicode

- `fast`_ and lightweight
- modular: pyratemp consists of several parts, which can be used separately,
  or even be replaced by an alternative implementation
- extensible: additional functions can be easily added to the templates,
  and due to its modularity, the parts can be modified or even replaced
- small code base, which is well documented and should be easy to read and
  understand
  (about 500 lines-of-code + 500 lines of docstrings and comments)

Quickstart
==========

:Note:
    Most examples are in Python 2 syntax.
    To use them in Python 3, replace ``u"..."`` by ``"..."``

Let's begin with an extremely simple example. Start your python-interpreter,
and type::

    >>> import pyratemp
    >>> t = pyratemp.Template("Hello @!name!@.")
    >>> print t(name="World")
    Hello World.
    >>> print t(name="Universe")
    Hello Universe.


Now, let's go to a more comprehensive example. Here, we put the template
in a separate file, named `example.html`::

    <!--(set_escape)-->
        html
    <!--(end)-->
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
              "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>A simple example: @!title!@</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>@!title!@</h1>
      This is a simple example, demonstrating pyratemp:
      #! Comments don't appear in the result !#
      <ul>

        <li>@!special_chars!@</li>

        <li>
          <!--(if number==42)-->
            The Answer!
          <!--(elif number==13)-->
            oh no!
          <!--(else)-->
            @!number!@
          <!--(end)-->
        </li>

        <li>a simple for loop: <!--(for i in range(1,10))--> @!i!@ <!--(end)--></li>

        <li>listing all enumerated elements of a list:
          <ul>
          <!--(for i,element in enumerate(mylist))-->
            <li>@!i+1!@. @!element.upper()!@</li>
          <!--(end)-->
          </ul>
        </li>

    <!--(macro myitem)-->
    <li><strong>@!item!@</strong></li>
    <!--(end)-->
        @!myitem(item="foo")!@
        @!myitem(item="bar")!@

      </ul>

    </body>
    </html>

Start python again, and type::

    >>> import pyratemp
    >>> t = pyratemp.Template(filename="example.html")
    >>> result = t(title="pyratemp is simple!", special_chars=u"""<>"'&äöü""", number=42, mylist=("Spam", "Parrot", "Lumberjack"))
    >>> print result.encode("ascii", 'xmlcharrefreplace')

And here is the result::

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
              "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>A simple example: pyratemp is simple!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>pyratemp is simple!</h1>
      This is a simple example, demonstrating pyratemp:

      <ul>

        <li>&lt;&gt;&quot;&#39;&amp;&#228;&#246;&#252;</li>

        <li>
            The Answer!
        </li>

        <li>a simple for loop:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 </li>

        <li>listing all enumerated elements of a list:
          <ul>
            <li>1. SPAM</li>
            <li>2. PARROT</li>
            <li>3. LUMBERJACK</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>foo</strong></li>
        <li><strong>bar</strong></li>

      </ul>

    </body>
    </html>


You can also use `pyratemp_tool`_ with the included `example.html` and
`example.json` to play with this example.

More small examples can be found in the pyratemp-docstring
(-> ``pydoc pyratemp``).


Template syntax
===============

A template is a normal text file, containing some special placeholders and
control-structures.

pyratemp uses only a *very small set* of control-structures
(if/elif/else, for/else, macro, raw, include, set_escape)
and little special template-syntax
($!..!$, @!..!@, #!..!#, <!--(...)-->).
This makes the templates both easy to use and easy to understand [#]_.

Note that you can find several small examples in the pyratemp-docstring.

.. [#] "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do
   it." [`The Zen of Python`_])


Substitution
------------
The template can contain placeholders, which are replaced by the evaluated
result of their contents. pyratemp has two different placeholders:

- ``@!EXPR!@`` escaped substitution: special characters are escaped
- ``$!EXPR!$`` unescaped/raw substitution

Normally, you should always use ``@!...!@``, since this escapes special
characters. Currently, the following formats are supported:

- HTML (default): ``& < > " '`` are escaped to ``&amp;``,
  ``&lt;``, ``&gt;``, ``&quot;``, ``&#39``.
- MAIL_HEADER: encode non-ASCII mail-headers
- LATEX: ``\ # $ % & { } _ ~ ^`` are escaped.
- NONE: no characters are replaced

``EXPR`` can be any `expression`_ (e.g. a variable-name, an arithmetic
calculation, a function-/macro-call etc.), and is evaluated when the template
is rendered. Whitespace after ``@!``/``$!`` and before ``!@``/``!$`` is
ignored.

Examples:

- | ``hello @!name!@.`` + `name="marvin"`
  | -> ``hello marvin.``
- | ``hello escaped: @!name!@, unescaped: $!name!$`` + `name="<>&'\""`
  | -> ``hello escaped: &lt;&gt;&amp;&#39;&quot;, unescaped: <>&\'"``
- | ``formatted: @! "%8.5f" % value !@`` + `value=3.141592653`
  | -> ``formatted:  3.14159``
- | ``hello --@!name.upper().center(20)!@--`` + `name="world"`
  | -> ``hello --       WORLD        --``
- | ``calculate @!var*5+7!@`` + `var=7`
  | -> ``calculate 42``

.. _expression: `Expressions`_


Comments
--------
Comments can be used in a template, and they do not appear in the result.
They are especially useful for (a) documenting the template, (b) temporarily
disabling parts of the template or (c) suppressing whitespace.

- ``#!...!#`` single-line comment with start- and end-tag
- ``#!...``  single-line-comment until end-of-line, incl. newline

The second version also comments out the newline, and so can be used at the
end of a line to remove that newline in the result (like a backslash in
Python-strings).

Comments can contain anything, but comments may not appear inside
substitutions or block-tags.


Blocks
------
The control-structures, macros etc. have a special syntax, which consists
of a start-tag (which is named according to the block), optional additional
tags, and an end-tag::

    <!--(...)-->        #! start tag
       ..
       ..
    <!--(...)-->        #! optional additional tags (e.g. for elif)
       ..
       ..
    <!--(end)-->        #! end tag

All tags must stand on their own line, and no code (except a ``#!...``-comment)
is allowed after the tag.

All tags which belong to the same block **must** have the same indent!
The contents of the block does not need to be indented, although it might
improve the readability (e.g. in HTML) to indent the contents as well.

Nesting blocks is possible, but the tags of nested blocks **must**
have a different indent than the tags of the enclosing blocks. [#]_


There's also a single-line version of a block, which does not need to stand on
its own line, but can be inserted anywhere in the template.
But note that this version does not support nesting [#]_::

    ...<!--(...)-->...<!--(...)-->...<!--(end)-->...


.. [#] Note that you should either use spaces *or* tabs for indentation. Since
    pyratemp distinguishes between spaces and tabs, if you mix spaces and
    tabs, two indentations might *look* the same (e.g. 8 spaces or 1 tab) but
    still be different, which might lead to unexpected errors.

.. [#] Although if you really want to nest single-line blocks, you
   nevertheless can do that by hiding the inner blocks in macros.


if/elif/else
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Syntax::

    <!--(if EXPR)-->
    ...
    <!--(elif EXPR)-->
    ...
    <!--(else)-->
    ...
    <!--(end)-->

or::

    ...<!--(if EXPR)-->...<!--(elif EXPR)-->...<!--(else)-->...<!--(end)-->...

The elif- and else-branches are optional, and there can be any number of
elif-branches.


for/else
~~~~~~~~

Syntax::

    <!--(for VARS in EXPR)-->
    ...
    <!--(else)-->
    ...
    <!--(end)-->

::

    ...<!--(for VARS in EXPR)-->...<!--(else)-->...<!--(end)-->...

| ``VARS`` can be a single variable-name (e.g. ``myvar``) or a comma-separated
  list of variable-names (e.g. ``i,val``).

The else-branch is optional, and is executed only if the for-loop doesn't
iterate at all.


macro
~~~~~

Macros are user-defined "sub-templates", and so can contain anything a
template itself can contain. They can have parameters and are normally
used to encapsulate parts of a template and to create user-defined
"functions". Macros can be used in `expressions`_, just like a normal
variable or function.

Definition::

    <!--(macro MACRONAME)-->
    ...
    <!--(end)-->

::

    ...<!--(macro MACRONAME)-->...<!--(end)-->...

``MACRONAME`` may consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores (``[0-9A-Za-z_]+``).

Note that the last newline (before ``<!--(end)-->``) is removed from the
macro, so that defining and using a macro does not add additional empty
lines.

Usage in expressions::

    MACRONAME

::

    MACRONAME(KEYWORD_ARGs)

``KEYWORD_ARGs`` can be any number of comma-separated name-value-pairs
(``name=value, ...``), and these names then will be locally defined inside
the macro -- in addition to those already defined for the whole template.

Example::

    <!--(macro header)-->
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>A simple example: @!title!@</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <!--(end)-->

    <!--(macro myfunc)-->
    <li><!--(if exists("link"))--><a href="@!link!@">@!default("item",link)!@</a><!--(else)-->@!item!@<!--(end)--></li>
    <!--(end)-->


    @!header!@
    <ul>
    @!myfunc(item="Macros are fun!")!@
    @!myfunc(item="Simple is better", link="http://www.simple-is-better.org")!@
    @!myfunc(link="http://www.wikipedia.org")!@
    </ul>


Macros are protected against double-escaping, so if you use ``@!MACRONAME!@``
or ``@!MACRONAME(...)!@``, the result of the macro is not escaped again,
and behaves exactly like ``$!MACRONAME!$`` or ``$!MACRONAME(...)!$``.
But note that this only works if the macro is used as single expression
inside ``@!...!@`` -- if you use additional expressions in the same
substitution, e.g. ``@!MACRONAME + "hi"!@``, then the result would be
escaped again.


raw
~~~

Syntax::

    <!--(raw)-->
    ...
    <!--(end)-->

::

    ...<!--(raw)-->...<!--(end)-->...

Everything inside a ``raw`` block is passed verbatim to the result.


include
~~~~~~~

Syntax::

    <!--(include)-->
      FILENAME
    <!--(end)-->

::

    ...<!--(include)-->FILENAME<!--(end)-->...

Include another template-file. Only a single filename (+whitespace) is
allowed inside of the block; if you want to include several files, use
several include-blocks.

Note that inclusion of other templates is only supported when loading the
template from a file. For simplicity and security, ``FILENAME`` may not
contain a path, and only files which are in the same directory as the
template itself can be included.


set_escape
~~~~~~~~~~
Since the template-engine can be used for all kind of documents, it may be
useful if the calling Python-code doesn't need to know which format the
template is of. But then, the template itself has to define its format,
and especially which special characters should be escaped.

Syntax::

    <!--(set_escape)-->
      FORMAT
    <!--(end)-->

::

    ...<!--(set_escape)-->FORMAT<!--(end)-->...

Currently, ``FORMAT`` supports ``"None"``, ``"HTML"``, ``"mail_header"`` and
``"LaTeX"`` (see `Substitution`_) [#]_.

``set_escape`` affects every substitution in the template *after* this command.
It's also possible to use different escapings in the same template by using
several such ``set_escape`` blocks at different places.


.. [#] Note that ``FORMAT`` is case-insensitive, so e.g. ``html``,
   ``Html`` and ``HTML`` are equal, and that whitespace around
   ``FORMAT`` is ignored.

Expressions
-----------
A template needs some kind of "programming-language" to access variables,
calculate things, format data, check conditions etc. inside the template.
So, you could invent and implement an own language therefore -- or you
could use an already existing and well designed language: Python.

pyratemp uses embedded Python-expressions.
An expression is everything which evaluates to a value, e.g. variables,
arithmetics, comparisons, boolean expressions, function/method calls,
list comprehensions etc. [#]_. And such Python expressions can be directly
used in the template -- this makes pyratemp very powerful.
But since it would be a bad idea to directly embed unrestricted Python-code
in a template, these expressions are restricted by a `pseudo-sandbox`_.


Examples:

- numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, ...: ``12.34``, ``"hello"``, ``[1,2,3]``, ...
- variable-access: ``var``, ``mylist[i]``, ``mydict["key"]``, ``myclass.attr``
- function/method call: ``myfunc(...)``, ``"foobar".upper()``
- comparison: ``(i < 0  or  j > 1024)``
- arithmetics: ``1+2``

For details, please read the Python-documentation about Python expressions.

Note that accessing *undefined variables* in the template is considered to be
an error. I chose this behaviour in contrast to many other template-engines
(which often ignore undefined variables), since ignoring undefined variables
would silently hide some errors, which is a bad idea. For ignoring or using
a default-value for undefined variables, see ``default()`` below.


The following Python-built-in values/functions are available by default
in the template::

    True
    False
    None

    abs()
    chr()
    cmp()       [removed in 0.3.0]
    divmod()
    hash()
    hex()
    isinstance() [new in 0.3.1 / 0.2.4]
    len()
    max()
    min()
    oct()
    ord()
    pow()
    range()
    round()
    sorted()
    sum()
    unichr()
    zip()

    bool()
    bytes()     [new in 0.3.0]
    complex()
    dict()
    enumerate()
    float()
    int()
    list()
    long()
    reversed()
    set()       [new in 0.3.1 / 0.2.4]
    str()
    tuple()
    unicode()
    xrange()    [removed in 0.3.0]

    dir()       [new in 0.3.1 / 0.2.4]

Additionally, the functions ``exists()``, ``default()``, ``setvar()`` and
``escape()`` are defined as follows:

``exists("varname")``:
    Test if a variable (or any other object) with the name *varname*
    exists (in the current locals-namespace). Note that the name of the
    variable has to be quoted, and that this only works for single variable
    names, e.g. ``exists("mylist")``. If you want to test more complicated
    expressions, use the ``default()``-function.

    It's especially useful in if-conditions to check if some (optional)
    variable exists, and then to branch accordingly.

    Example::

        <!--(if exists("foo"))-->YES<!--(else)-->NO<!--(end)-->

``default("expr", default=None)``:
    ``default()`` tries to evaluate the expression *expr*. If the evaluation
    succeeds and the result is not ``None``, its value is returned;
    otherwise, if the expression contains undefined variables/attributes, the
    *default*-value is returned instead.
    Note that *expr* has to be quoted.

    Since it is considered an error when the template tries to evaluate an
    undefined variable, this can be used to use default-values for optional
    variables, e.g. ``Name: @!default("myvar", "No name given.")!@``.

    Examples::

        hi @!default("optional","anyone")!@

        @!default("5*var1+var2","missing variable")!@

        <!--(if default("opt1+opt2",0) > 0)-->yes<!--(else)-->no<!--(end)-->

        <!--(for i in default("optional_list",[]))-->@!i!@<!--(end)-->

``setvar("name", "expr")``:
    Although there is often a more elegant way, sometimes it is useful or
    necessary to set variables in the template. ``setvar()`` can also be
    used to capture the output of e.g. an evaluated macro.

    Note that variables, which are set inside of a macro, can not be accessed
    outside of the macro.

    Example::

        $!setvar("i", "i+1")!$

``escape("string", format=HTML)``:
    Escape special characters. This is the same function, pyratemp uses
    internally for ``@!...!@``, with a configurable format.

    Supported formats: ``"None"``, ``"HTML"``, ``"mail_header"``, ``"LaTeX"``

    Example::

        $!escape(subject, "MAIL_HEADER")!$

Note that you can use any expression evaluating to the desired string/value
for all parameters (`varname`, `expr`, `default`, `name`) above.

Please look into the pyratemp-docstrings for more examples of ``exists()``,
``default()`` and ``setvar()``.

More/user-defined functions can be added to the template as "data"
(see `User-interface`_), or by extending the `evaluator`_.

.. _evaluator: `Evaluation`_


.. [#] Note that only Python *expressions* can be used, Python *statements*
   are not possible. In contrast to Python expressions, statements do not
   have a value but "do something" (e.g. if/for, print, raise, return, import
   etc.). See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_%28programming%29
   and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_%28programming%29.


Python-side
===========

pyratemp is modular and consists of several parts:

- First, the template is loaded,
- then, it is syntax-checked and parsed into a tree,
- later, it is rendered with some data, using
- some kind of evaluation for the expressions
- and some escaping for the substitutions.

Normally, you don't really need to know these parts, and may simply use the
"user-interface" of the template-engine. If you are only interested in how to
use the template-engine, it's enough to read the `User-interface`_-section
below and skip the rest of this chapter.
But for all who want to know more, here are also some details of the internal
concepts of pyratemp.

Note that pyratemp makes heavy use of docstrings, and all classes, functions
etc. are documented there, so please read them (e.g. with ``pydoc pyratemp``).


User-interface
--------------

The user-interface of the template-engine consists of a single class:
``pyratemp.Template``. This loads a template, checks its syntax, parses
it, and can render it with your data.

``class Template(string|filename|parsetree, encoding="utf-8", data=None, escape=HTML)``:
    Load (and parse) a template. The template can either be directly given
    as string, or loaded from a file, or an already parsed template can be used.

    ``encoding`` sets the charset-encoding of the loaded template (default: UTF-8).

    ``data`` can be a dictionary containing some data which should be filled
    into the template by default (=if the variables etc. are not given
    when calling/rendering the template).

    ``escape`` defines which special-characters should be escaped in
    substitutions by default (currently supported: ``NONE``, ``HTML``,
    ``MAIL_HEADER`` and ``LATEX``).
    The escaping can also be set directly in the template (see `set_escape`_),
    and setting the escape-format in the template overrides the one set here.

    Note that you have to use keyword-parameters here!

To *render* the template, simply *call* the template with your data as
(keyword-)parameters. This returns the result in Unicode, and you should
encode it depending on your needs. Of course, the same template can be
rendered several times with different data.

Example::

    >>> import pyratemp
    >>> t = pyratemp.Template(filename="test.html", data={"number": 1}, escape=pyratemp.HTML)
    >>> result1 = t(person="Monty")
    >>> result2 = t(person="Adams", number=42)
    >>> print result1.encode("utf-8")
    >>> print result2.encode("ascii", 'xmlcharrefreplace')

Note that ``data`` (and the keyword-parameters when calling the template) can
contain nearly anything: single variables, lists, other dictionaries, nested
structures, functions and even classes. So **be careful** what you pass
to the template. If you e.g. pass the Python-built-in-function ``open``
to the template, your template will be able to open (and write) arbitrary
files!

-----------------------

In addition, version 0.3.1/0.2.4 added a new file ``tools.py``, which eases
the creation of html-files and mails.

Example::

    >>> from pyratemp.tools import html, mail

    >>> result = html(template="test.tmpl", data={"number": 1}, xmlreplace=True)
    >>> print result

    >>> html(template="test.tmpl", data={"number": 1}, xmlreplace=True, filename="result.html")

    >>> mail(maildir="outbox/", template="mail.tmpl", data={"from": "me@example.org"})


Internal parts
--------------
As said before, pyratemp consists of several parts, which are independent:

- an escaping-function (``escape()``)
- a template-loader (``class LoaderString`` or ``class LoaderFile``)
- a parser (``class Parser``)
- a pseudo-sandboxed evaluator (``class EvalPseudoSandbox``)
- a renderer (``class Renderer``)
- a basic template-structure, e.g. used for macros/subtemplates
  (``class TemplateBase``)

All parts could even be used on their own, or modified (e.g. by creating
subclasses) or replaced by an other implementation.
Modified parts can then be used by setting the parameters ``loader_class``,
``parser_class``, ``renderer_class``, ``eval_class`` or ``escape_func`` of
``class Template``, or by creating a modified template-user-interface-class.

Read the pyratemp-docstrings for details.

escaping
~~~~~~~~
Currently, HTML-, e-mail-header- and LaTeX-escaping are implemented in
the function ``escape()``. This may be extended in the future.

Note that escaping is currently one of the most time-consuming parts when
rendering a template.

Loader
~~~~~~
There are two sources to "load" a template from: either directly from a
string, or from a file. Since templates-from-files can include other templates,
this "template-loading" is encapsulated into classes (``class LoaderString``
and ``class LoaderFile``).

These classes contain a function ``load(...)``, which actually loads the
template and returns the result in Unicode.

Inclusion of other templates (by using ``<!--(include)-->)``) is only possible
when loading the template from a file, and (for simplicity and security) all
included templates have to be in the same directory as the including template
(see ``allowed_path`` of ``class LoaderFile``).

Parser
~~~~~~
It's better, cleaner and even faster to parse the template first and afterwards
separately render it (maybe multiple times).

The parser (``class Parser``) analyzes the template-string, checks the syntax
(and throws exceptions with detailed error-descriptions if there is an error),
and generates a parse-tree. Since indentation is used for nesting in the
template, the template can be completely parsed by using regexps, which
makes parsing really fast and simple.

Most of the parser-code is used to check for (syntax-)errors and to create
error-messages.

The resulting parse-tree is a recursive list, with the following elements:

- ``("str", STRING)`` (for unprocessed template-data and "raw")
- ``("sub", EXPR)`` (for unescaped substitution)
- ``("esc", ESCAPEFORMAT, EXPR)`` (for escaped substitution)
- ``("for", NAMETUPLE, ITEREXPR, [...])``
- ``("if",   PARAM, [...])``
- ``("elif", PARAM, [...])``
- ``("else", PARAM, [...])``
- ``("macro", PARAM, [...])``

Examples (see `Quickstart`_):

- parse-tree of ``"Hello @!name!@."``::

    [('str', u'Hello '), ('esc', 1, u'name'), ('str', u'.')]

- parse-tree of `example.html`_, formatted for readability::

    [('str', u'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"\n          "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>A simple example: '),
     ('esc', 1, u'title'),
     ('str', u'</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>'),
     ('esc', 1, u'title'),
     ('str', u'</h1>\n  This is a simple example, demonstrating pyratemp:\n  \n  <ul>\n    \n    <li>'),
     ('esc', 1, u'special_chars'),
     ('str', u'</li>\n\n    <li>\n'),
     ('if',  u'number==42',
        [('str', u'        The Answer!\n')]),
     ('elif', u'number==13',
        [('str', u'        oh no!\n')]),
     ('else',
        [('str', u'        '),
         ('esc', 1, u'number'),
         ('str', u'\n')]),
     ('str', u'    </li>\n\n    <li>a simple for loop: '),
     ('for', (u'i',), u'range(1,10)',
        [('str', u' '),
         ('esc', 1, u'i'),
         ('str', u' ')]),
     ('str', u'</li>\n\n    <li>listing all enumerated elements of a list:\n      <ul>\n'),
     ('for', (u'i', u'element'), u'enumerate(mylist)',
        [('str', u'        <li>'),
         ('esc', 1, u'i+1'),
         ('str', u'. '),
         ('esc', 1, u'element.upper()'),
         ('str', u'</li>\n')]),
     ('str', u'      </ul>\n    </li>\n\n'),
     ('macro', u'myitem',
        [('str', u'<li><strong>'),
         ('esc', 1, u'item'),
         ('str', u'</strong></li>')]),
     ('str', u'    '),
     ('esc', 1, u'myitem(item="foo")'),
     ('str', u'\n    '),
     ('esc', 1, u'myitem(item="bar")'),
     ('str', u'\n\n  </ul>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n')]


Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~
pyratemp uses Python-expressions [#]_ in its templates.

But since it is a really bad idea to directly embed unrestricted code into a
template [#]_, pyratemp uses a "pseudo-sandbox" for evaluating the
Python-expressions. This restricts the embedded expressions, so that the
template-designer only has the necessary functionality and cannot do
"bad things" by accident.

This pseudo-sandbox is implemented in the ``class EvalPseudoSandbox``.
It only allows a (safe) subset of the Python-builtins and adds some
additional functions (``exists()``, ``default()``, ``setvar()`` and
a dummy ``__import__()``; see `Expressions`_).
It also forbids access to names beginning with ``_``, to prevent things
like ``0 .__class__``, which could be used to break out of the sandbox.

See docstring for details.

*But note that this may not be a real sandbox!*
Although I currently don't know *any* way to break out of this sandbox, and
I think that it shouldn't be possible to break out (without passing in an
unsafe function [#]_), I'm not absolutely sure about that.

So, if you want to use pyratemp for "untrusted" templates, you should make
sure that nothing bad can happen. There are different possible ways:

- Approve that it's not possible to break out of the integrated
  "pseudo-sandbox".
- Make sure that nothing bad can happen even if someone breaks out of
  the sandbox (e.g. by appropriate rights).
- | Add a really sandboxed expression-evaluator, and use it instead of the
    ``EvalPseudoSandbox`` class. This could even be done incrementally, by
    first writing a simple evaluator which only supports string-substitution,
    and then adding comparisons, arithmetics and other functionality as needed.
  | But since such a sandboxed evaluator would increase the complexity and
    probably would only support a subset of the Python-expressions, I did
    not write such an evaluator yet.


.. [#] Note that there is a difference between Python-expressions (`eval()`)
       and Python-statements (`exec()`). pyratemp only uses `eval`.
       (see also: `Expressions`_)
.. [#] With unrestricted embedded python, bad things like accessing, reading
       and modifying parts of the system (``open("/etc/passwd").read()`` or
       worse) would be possible. In addition to that, unrestricted code would
       also tempt the template-designer to break the model-view-separation.
.. [#] Of course, you should not give the template a "bad" function with its
       data. If you do something like ``t(badfunc=open)``, then the template
       will of course be able to open arbitrary files...

Renderer
~~~~~~~~
The renderer (``class Renderer``) takes a parse-tree and your data, evaluates
all embedded expressions and control-structures, expands the macros, escapes
special characters (and tries to prevent double-escapes) and returns the
result as Unicode-string.

TemplateBase
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``class TemplateBase`` on the one hand implements parts of the
user-interface, on the other hand provides the functionality for
user-defined macros in the template. Remember that a macro in the
template is exactly the same as a (sub-)template!

Compiler
~~~~~~~~
I also wrote a small (about 100 lines) experimental compiler which compiles
the templates (or: the parse-trees) to pure Python-code. It's quite simple,
and may even speed up the rendering a bit. But since pyratemp is already
very fast, and compiling only has advantages if you render a template
many times, I haven't developed the compiler any further.


Usage notes/FAQ
===============

syntax errors
-------------

To check a pyratemp-template for syntax-errors, simply let pyratemp parse
the template.
You can do this e.g. with `pyratemp_tool`_ with ``-s`` and without any data::

    $ pyratemp_tool.py -s TEMPLATEFILE(s)

If there are syntax-errors, pyratemp raises a ``TemplateSyntaxError``, and
pyratemp_tool displays a detailed error-message::

    $ pyratemp_tool.py -s TEMPLATEFILE
    file 'TEMPLATEFILE':
      TemplateSyntaxError: line ##, col ##: ...


fillout/render test
-------------------

For a complete test, you have to render the template. Of course you can do
this in your application, with real data, but probably it's easier to test
it outside of the application with some "dummy data".

This again can be done by `pyratemp_tool`_. Simply create a JSON-file
(or a YAML-file) with your dummy data, and invoke pyratemp_tool. If the
JSON-/YAML-file contains all necessary data, the rendered template will
be written to ``stdout``, e.g.::

    $ pyratemp_tool.py -f example.json example.html
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
              "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
    <html>
    <head>
    ...

Otherwise, if some data is missing (or invalid) or some expressions are
invalid, pyratemp raises a ``TemplateRenderError`` and tells you what
data is missing, e.g.::

    $ pyratemp_tool.py -f dummydata.json example.html
    file 'example.html':
      TemplateRenderError: Cannot eval expression 'title' (NameError: name 'title' is not defined)

whitespace handling
-------------------
If you need to remove some whitespace (e.g. a newline), you can put it into
`comments`_, e.g. a ``#!`` at the end of a line removes the newline in the
result.

setting variables
-----------------
There's sometimes the wish to set variables in the template. But there's often
a more elegant way to solve the problem without setting variables.

For example, instead of::

    <!--(for obj in arr)-->
        @!i!@. @!obj!@
        $!setvar("i", "i+1")!$ #!
    <!--(end)-->

better use::

    <!--(for i,obj in enumerate(arr))-->
        @!i!@. @!obj!@
    <!--(end)-->

But if you really need to set variables, you can use ``setvar()``
(see `Expressions`_).

capture output
--------------
To capture the output of a macro into a variable, you can also use
``setvar()``::

    <!--(macro mymacro)-->
    ...
    <!--(end)-->
    $!setvar("myvar", "mymacro()")!$#!

filters
-------
Some template-engines have so-called "filters", which are functions which
process the contents of a whole block. This behaviour can be easily
achieved with pyratemp, too::

    <!--(macro myblock)-->
    ...
    <!--(end)-->
    $!filter(myblock())!$

select macro / overwrite macro
------------------------------
Macros can be overwritten, even based on a conditional. This may be useful
if you want to globally change the output depending on some options.

Example::

    <!--(macro field)-->show_field $!param!$<!--(end)-->
    <!--(macro input_field)-->input_field $!param!$<!--(end)-->

    <!--(if x=="overwrite")-->
      <!--(macro field)-->
    @!input_field(param=param)!@
      <!--(end)-->
    <!--(end)-->

    @!field(p=1)!@

evaluation order / caches
-------------------------
The expressions, macros etc. are evaluated at *rendering*-time, not
at define-/parse-time.

So, e.g. a macro is evaluated each time it is called/used. If you want
something to be evaluated only once, no matter how often it is used,
you may:

- store the evaluation-result in a variable with ``setvar()``
  and then use the variable
- write a cache-function in Python and use it in your template

using functions which import other modules
------------------------------------------
Some Python-functions, which may be useful in the template, try to import
other modules, e.g. ``datetime.strftime`` imports ``time``. But importing
modules is of course not allowed in the (pseudo-)sandbox, so this fails.

The best solution would be to avoid these functions and e.g. use
``time.strftime`` instead of ``datetime.strftime``.

| For the cases where this is not possible, the pyratemp-pseudo-sandbox
  contains a dummy-import-function, which allows to virtually import modules
  which are already accessible from within the sandbox.
| But note that then the template maybe needs to have access to the
  complete "imported" module (in the example: complete ``time`` module,
  plus probably large parts of the ``datetime`` module),
  which might be a *security risk* and break the sandbox!
| See the docstring of ``EvalPseudoSandbox.f_import`` for details.

shortcuts / template-syntax-extension
-------------------------------------
Sometimes shortcuts for often-used things might be useful.
Therefore, you can:

- | Define macros.
  | This is probably the most common way.

- | Define a Python-function and pass it to the template.
  | (But take care that you don't break the model-view-separation!)

- | Extend the template-syntax. [advanced]
  | This essentially modifies the template-engine, and you should only
    do this if you are *really* sure that you want it, and that the
    alternatives do not work in your case!

  The simplest way to introduce new syntax probably is to load the
  template-file, map your new syntax (e.g. with regexps) to normal
  pyratemp-syntax, and let pyratemp do the rest.

  Example: The new syntax ``@x!...!x@`` should be added, which should
  do the same as ``@!myfunc(...)!@``::

    import re
    import pyratemp

    class MyLoader(pyratemp.LoaderFile):
        my_replacement = re.compile(r'@x!\s*(.*?)\s*!x@')

        load(self, filename):
            u = pyratemp.LoaderFile(self, filename)
            u = my_replacement.sub(r'@! myfunc("\1") !@', u)
            return u

    t = pyratemp.Template(..., loader_class=MyLoader)


return data from the template to the caller
-------------------------------------------
In some rare cases, it might be useful to return data (e.g. a returncode) from
the template to the caller. This is possible with pyratemp. *But note that this
can easily break the model-view-separation, so think twice about it before
using it, and use it with care!*

Example::

    import pyratemp

    retdict = {}
    def setreturn(name, value):
        """Quick-hack to export data from the template to the code.
        """
        retdict[name] = value
        return ""

    t = pyratemp.Template("""Return myreturn=True to the caller: @!setreturn("myreturn", True)!@""")
    t(setreturn=setreturn)
    print("retdict: %s" % retdict) 


Tools
=====

pyratemp_tool
-------------

``pyratemp_tool.py`` is a simple command-line-interface to pyratemp which
can (a) syntax-check the templates and (b) fill/render templates with the data
from JSON- or YAML-files or from key-value-pairs from the command-line.
Errors/messages are print to stderr, rendered templates are written to
``stdout`` in UTF-8.

By default, HTML-escaping is used for ``*.html`` and ``*.htm``, LaTeX-escaping
is used for ``*.tex`` and no escaping is used for other files. Use `set_escape`_
if you need a different encoding.

Two additional variables are defined: ``date`` and ``mtime_CCYYMMDD``,
both containing the current date in the "YYYY-MM-DD"-format.

Usage (see also ``pyratemp_tool.py --help`` and ``pydoc pyratemp_tool``)::

    pyratemp_tool.py [-s] <-d NAME=VALUE> <-f DATAFILE [-N NAME] [-n NR_OF_ENTRY]> [--xml] TEMPLATEFILES
        -s      syntax-check only (don't render the template)
        -d      define variables (these also override the values from files)
        -f      use variables from a JSON/YAML file
        -n      use nth entry of the JSON/YAML file
                (JSON: n-th element of the root-array, YAML: n-th entry)
        -N      namespace for variables from the JSON/YAML file
        --xml   encode output as ASCII+xmlcharrefreplace (instead of utf-8)

For the 2nd example of `Quickstart`_, a JSON-file might look like::

    {
      "title" : "filling JSON into pyratemp",
      "special_chars" : "µ<ß€",
      "number" : 13,
      "mylist" : [ "JSON", "YAML", "manually-defined variables" ]
    }

To fill the template, with using a different value for ``number`` than
in the JSON-file, invoke pyratemp_tool as follows::

    $ pyratemp_tool.py -d number=42 -f example.json example.html > filled.html

Now, the result is in ``filled.html``


Download
========

pyratemp is used in several applications for several years now without any
problems and it's quite stable. But it has been tested only by a few people,
so there may still be bugs in it. Please report any problems.

pyratemp consists of a single python-file, which you can directly copy
into some directory where ``import`` can find it, e.g. the same directory
as your other code.
